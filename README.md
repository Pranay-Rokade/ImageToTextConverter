# Image to Text Converter

This Python script converts text from images into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. It utilizes Pytesseract for OCR functionality and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image handling.

## Features

- **Image to Text Conversion:** Converts text embedded within images into plain text output.
- **Supports Various Formats:** Works with popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
- **Easy-to-Use:** Simple Python script with straightforward setup and execution.

## Libraries Used

- **Pytesseract:** Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It extracts text from images and utilizes machine learning algorithms to perform OCR
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** Adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is used to open and preprocess images before OCR.
